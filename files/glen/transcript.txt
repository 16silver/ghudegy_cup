END OF DIALOGUE


[calamus_shock] Niko! Alula just disappeared again!
[niko_surprised] What? She was with us until five minutes ago!
[niko_shock] She stayed in the front yard, didn't she?
[calamus_sad] It seems they started to invade the front\nyard now.
[niko_eyeclosed] It's getting more and more dangerous...
[niko_speak] I think she is trapped in the same place.\nWe should go there right now!
-- insert "a few minutes later" here --
[alula_oh] Calamus! Niko!
[calamus_shock] Alula! Are you okay?
[alula_gasp2] Yes!
[alula_pout] I can't get out of here though...
[niko_speak] Don't worry! We will find a way!
[calamus] So, how did you save her back then?
[niko] There should be a set of tiles arranged\nin a rectangle in this room.
[niko_speak] If you step on the tile, some mark\nappears on the tile!
[calamus_speak] Oh! I think I stepped on one of them.
[calamus] And if I step on it again...
[calamus_speak] The mark disappears.
[niko] Using these tiles, you are supposed to\ndraw a shape. That's the end.
[calamus] Then... They just disappear?
[niko] I... don't really know how it works.
[niko] Anyway, that's basically the whole thing.\nBut...
[niko_what] This room used to be much smaller than\nright now...
[alula_gasp2] The walls moved by themselves!
[niko_wtf2] How did that happen?
[calamus_heh] I had a feeling that this room was\nmuch larger than I remembered.
[calamus] What is the shape that you had to draw?
[niko] It was something I saw here and there.\nIt looked like the sun!
[calamus_speak] Oh! I think I know what you're talking\nabout.
[niko] Actually, I had no idea that was the\nanswer.
[niko_speak] Coder seemed to know, though!
[niko] So, maybe Coder knows what we are supposed\nto draw this time.
[alula_gasp] Oh, and something is written here!
[niko] Huh?
[alula] It says... Niko must start on the\nspecific position.
[alula] One step to the left of the upper left corner\ntile.
[alula_speak] I have no idea what that means, but that\nsounds strange!
[niko] Aha! So I should be standing there...
[niko] Weird, that was not needed when I first\nsaved Alula...
[calamus] I wonder who is designing these puzzles.
[calamus_sad] What's really happening to this world?
[alula] And, Niko must move at most three times?
[niko_what] Only three times?
[alula_gasp2] Oh! Number of tiles!
[calamus] Three times the number of tiles?
[alula_gasp] Yes!
[alula] If Niko moves too much, Coder will get\nTeullyeotsumnida.
[alula_speak] That sounds like something Magpie would\nhave!
[niko] Teul what? Who is Magpie?
[alula] Y'know, the trader guy!
[alula_speak] He collects all kinds of funny stuff!
[niko_speak] Oh! I think I met him before.
[alula] And finally, if there is no solution,\nWrite -1!
[niko] I have a pen, but where should I write that?\nCalamus, do you have some paper?
[calamus] Nope.
[niko_eyeclosed] Those messages are cryptic...
[calamus_speak] I have a guess... Maybe those messages\nare directed to Coder.
[calamus] So it's Coder who has to write -1\nsomewhere.
[niko] Makes sense! And maybe teullyeot something\nis a bad thing to Coder.
[alula_speak] Teullyeotsumnida!
[calamus] Anyway, we have to wait for Coder to\nanswer, right?
[alula_gasp] Coder will save us!
[niko] M-hm!
END OF DIALOGUE

[input]

On the first line, I will give two positive integers N and M.

N is the number of rows, and M is the number of columns.

Both integers are at most 100.

Each of the next N lines will describe each row of the painting Niko will have to draw.

The cells form a rectangle, remember?

"#" means the mark is on that cell, and "." means the mark is not on that cell.

[output]

Tell Niko exactly how they should move.

"U" for up, "D" for down, "L" for left, and "R" for right.

Niko is allowed to go out of the rectangle.
